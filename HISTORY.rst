------------------

* This version drops Google Sheets API v3 support.
    - API v4 was the default backend since version 2.0.0.
    - All v4-related code has been moved from `gspread.v4` module to `gspread` module.


2.1.1 (2018-04-08)
------------------

* Fixed #533 (#534 by @reallistic)

------------------

* URL encode the range in the value_* functions (#530 by @aiguofer)

2.0.0 (2018-03-11)
------------------

* Ported the library to Google Sheets API v4.

  This is a transition release. The v3-related code is untouched,
  but v4 is used by default. It is encouraged to move to v4 since
  the API is faster and has more features.

  API v4 is a significant change from v3. Some methods are not
  backward compatible, so there's no support for this compatibility
  in gspread either.

  These methods and properties are not supported in v4:

  * `Spreadsheet.updated`
  * `Worksheet.updated`
  * `Worksheet.export()`
  * `Cell.input_value`

  adverse effect on runtime for large worksheets.
