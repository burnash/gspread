Using OAuth2 for Authorization
==============================

OAuth Credentials
-----------------

OAuth credentials can be generated in several different ways using the
`oauth2client <https://github.com/google/oauth2client>`_ library provided by Google. If you are
editing spreadsheets for yourself then the easiest way to generate credentials is to use
*Signed Credentials* stored in your application (see example below). If you plan to edit
spreadsheets on behalf of others then visit the
`Google OAuth2 documentation <https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2>`_ for more
information.

Using Signed Credentials
------------------------
::

1. Head to `Google Developers Console <https://console.developers.google.com/project>`_ and create a new project (or select the one you have.)

2. Under "API & auth", in the API enable "Drive API".

4. Select "Service account". Hitting "Create Client ID" will generate a new Public/Private key pair.

You will automatically download a JSON file with this data.

This is how this file may look like:

::

    {
        "private_key_id": "2cd … ba4",
        "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nNrDyLw … jINQh/9\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
        "client_email": "473 … hd@developer.gserviceaccount.com",
        "client_id": "473 … hd.apps.googleusercontent.com",
        "type": "service_account"
    }

You'll need *client_email* and *private_key*.

**Note**: Python2 users do not need to encode ``json_key['private_key']`` due to ``str`` and ``bytes`` not being differentiated.


7. Go to Google Sheets and share your spreadsheet with an email you have in your ``json_key['client_email']``. Otherwise you'll get a ``SpreadsheetNotFound`` exception when trying to open it.

Custom Credentials Objects
--------------------------

If you have another method of authenicating you can easily hack a custom credentials object.

::

    class Credentials (object):
      def __init__ (self, access_token=None):
        self.access_token = access_token

      def refresh (self, http):
        # get new access_token
        # this only gets called if access_token is None
