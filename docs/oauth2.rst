Using OAuth2 for Authorization
==============================

OAuth Credentials
-----------------

OAuth credentials can be generated in several different ways using the
`oauth2client <https://github.com/google/oauth2client>`_ library provided by Google. If you are
editing spreadsheets for yourself then the easiest way to generate credentials is to use
*Signed Credentials* stored in your application (see example below). If you plan to edit
spreadsheets on behalf of others then visit the
`Google OAuth2 documentation <https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2>`_ for more
information.

Using Signed Credentials
------------------------
::

1. Head to `Google Developers Console <https://console.developers.google.com/project>`_ and create a new project (or select the one you have.)

2. Under "API & auth", in the API enable "Drive API".

3. Go to "Credentials" and choose "New Credentials > Service Account Key".

You will automatically download a JSON file with this data.

This is how this file may look like:

::

    {
        "private_key_id": "2cd … ba4",
        "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nNrDyLw … jINQh/9\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
        "client_email": "473 … hd@developer.gserviceaccount.com",
        "client_id": "473 … hd.apps.googleusercontent.com",
        "type": "service_account"
    }

You'll need *client_email* and *private_key*.

5. Install `oauth2client <https://github.com/google/oauth2client>`_:

::

    pip install --upgrade oauth2client

Depending on your system setup you may need to install PyOpenSSL:

::

    pip install PyOpenSSL

6. Now you can read this file, and use the data when constructing your credentials:

::

    import json
    import gspread
    from oauth2client.service_account import ServiceAccountCredentials

    scope = ['https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds']

    credentials = ServiceAccountCredentials.from_json_keyfile_name('gspread-april-2cd … ba4.json', scope)

    gc = gspread.authorize(credentials)

    wks = gc.open("Where is the money Lebowski?").sheet1

**Note**: Python2 users do not need to encode ``json_key['private_key']`` due to ``str`` and ``bytes`` not being differentiated.


7. Go to Google Sheets and share your spreadsheet with an email you have in your ``json_key['client_email']``. Otherwise you'll get a ``SpreadsheetNotFound`` exception when trying to open it.

Troubleshooting
---------------

oauth2client.client.CryptoUnavailableError: No crypto library available
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're getting the "No crypto library available" exception, make sure you have ``PyOpenSSL`` library installed in your environment.

Custom Credentials Objects
--------------------------

If you have another method of authenicating you can easily hack a custom credentials object.

::

    class Credentials (object):
      def __init__ (self, access_token=None):
        self.access_token = access_token

      def refresh (self, http):
        # get new access_token
        # this only gets called if access_token is None
