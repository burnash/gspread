Using OAuth2 for Authentication
===============================

OAuth Credentials
-----------------

OAuth credentials can be generated in several different ways using the
`oauth2client <https://github.com/google/oauth2client>`_ library provided by Google. If you are
editing spreadsheets for yourself then the easiest way to generate credentials is to use
*Signed Credentials* stored in your application (see example below). If you plan to edit
spreadsheets on behalf of others then visit the
`Google OAuth2 documentation <https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2>`_ for more
information.

Using Signed Credentials
------------------------
::

1. Head to `Google Developers Console <https://console.developers.google.com/project>`_ and create a new project (or select the one you have.)

2. Under "APIs & Services > Library", search for "Drive API" and enable it.
    
3. Under "APIs & Services > Library", search for "Sheets API" and enable it.

4. Go to "APIs & Services > Credentials" and choose "Create credentials > Service account key".

You will automatically download a JSON file with this data.

This is how this file may look like:

::

    {
        "private_key_id": "2cd … ba4",
        "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nNrDyLw … jINQh/9\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
        "client_email": "473000000000-yoursisdifferent@developer.gserviceaccount.com",
        "client_id": "473 … hd.apps.googleusercontent.com",
        "type": "service_account"
    }

In the next step you'll need the value of *client_email* from the file.

5. Go to your spreadsheet and share it with a *client_email* from the step above. Otherwise you'll get a ``gspread.exceptions.SpreadsheetNotFound`` exception when trying to access this spreadsheet with gspread.

6. Install `oauth2client <https://github.com/google/oauth2client>`_:

::

    pip install --upgrade oauth2client

Depending on your system setup you may need to install PyOpenSSL:

::

    pip install PyOpenSSL

7. Now you can read this file, and use the data when constructing your credentials:

::

    import gspread
    from oauth2client.service_account import ServiceAccountCredentials

    scope = ['https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds',
             'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive']

    credentials = ServiceAccountCredentials.from_json_keyfile_name('gspread-april-2cd … ba4.json', scope)

    gc = gspread.authorize(credentials)

    wks = gc.open("Where is the money Lebowski?").sheet1


Troubleshooting
---------------

oauth2client.client.CryptoUnavailableError: No crypto library available
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're getting the "No crypto library available" exception, make sure you have ``PyOpenSSL`` library installed in your environment.

Custom Credentials Objects
--------------------------

If you have another method of authenticating you can easily hack a custom credentials object.

::

    class Credentials (object):
      def __init__ (self, access_token=None):
        self.access_token = access_token

      def refresh (self, http):
        # get new access_token
        # this only gets called if access_token is None
